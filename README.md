## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The hero image was in multiple formats - I had to put them in a `picture` element and use `source` elements to specify the different formats. It felt a bit weird that I couldn't do the same in CSS, but I guess that's how it is.
